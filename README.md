# ML_BOOTCAMP

## WEEK1

Initially, I studied the python programming language from the sources provided to me by the mentor. I revised some prerequisites of mathematics like algebra,matrix, calculus from books and online resources. I also learned the use of various libraries and their algorithm to be used in the project later. I also learned to use various platforms for machine learning, and prominent ones the Jupyter notebook and Google Colab.

## WEEK 2
I  started preparing my first module of regression of linear type using the Jupyter notebook. Firstly I read various material and research papers for regression basically from the ANDREW N.G COURSE and write a code for the module. Similarly, another module, i.e. the logistic regression will initially require some mathematics of functions knowledge that I read. I also learned the algorithm and code it down in a Jupyter notebook and train this by implementing provided dataset.

## WEEK 3
I started the third module of K-NN this week by knowing the module’s algorithm , read various research papers, and resources provided by my mentor related to the module. Then I coded down the module’s program in Jupyter notebook, trained my module with MNIST Dataset provided by the mentor, and applied multiple datasets available online. Later, I also created a report based on all the workings, hyperparameters and training logs required by this module. The visualisation will be an essential part of this module, and hence I  also included the training visualisations in my report. I also gained the basic knowledge of the next module of Neural Networks.

 ## WEEK 4
I started the final And most crucial Neural network module by studying intensely about neural networks algorithms from Andrew N.G ML Course, i.e. how it senses the possible output by linking various environments to each other. I will be entirely open to the suggestions and guidance provided by my mentor. I will read various material like books, research papers, online material.Later, create the Jupyter notebook for module and train module by the given dataset and available online dataset. I included all the hyperparameters, training logs and training visualisations provided to the module in my report. In the end, I summed up all the modules together, their reports together and organise them to finalise the project.
